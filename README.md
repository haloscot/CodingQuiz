# CodingQuiz

The last week and a half have been very difficult for me personally and, while I wish I had better news, I was unable to complete this homework assignment by tonight.  I've been sick the past few days and really just didn't have it in me to push through and get it done.  I hope to have something pulled together by tomorrow evening, but understand if credit can't be given since I don't have anything to show at the time it's due.
